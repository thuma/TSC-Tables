Tables for converting ids between different systems of transportation.

This makes it possible to use the Natianl swedish IDs for local transit with for example SL.

The files are in cvs either ; och , separated. If , exists in the names of the stops then ; is used as a separator.

All files use the swedish national ID as reference. the field will be named something like gtfsid since the national IDs comes for the swedish GTFS export.
